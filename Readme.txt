Connor worked on the scalable formation and the emergent formation. John worked on the two level and helped with tuning the emergent formation. 

The agents use raycast for obstacle avoidance. The scalable formation uses additional raycasts to detect if they are near a wall. 
For going through the tunnel, the scalable formation and two level formation use triggers to determine if they should change the formation width.

The scalable formation's movement looks fairly bad but it doesn't hit anything. The emergent formation doesn't have a lot of variety in possible shapes, but it also doesn't hit anything and moves more naturally. The scalable formation is really slow but it looks much more professional than the others.
